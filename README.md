# Mole Analysis
 
There is a possibility of skin cancer every time cells in the body grow out of control. Cells in almost any part of the body can become malignancy, and could then spread to different areas of the body. Melanocyte is a highly differentiated cell that produces pigment melanin inside melanosomes. This cell is dark and dendritic. Melanin production is the basic function of the melanocyte. With the process of differentiation, this cell loses the proliferative potential. Melanoma may be a carcinoma that develops when melanocytes grow out of control. Melanoma is far less common than other sorts of skin cancers. But melanoma is more dangerous because it’s far more likely to spread to other parts of the body if not caught and treated early.

The purpose of the paper is to assist dermatologists within the analysis of moles by creating a model that can analyze a mole’s picture and extract two of its characteristics: its asymmetry and its border.
